What is e-Challan?e-Challan is the electronic form of a regular traffic fine challan, which is issued for traffic-related offenses. It is generated through the Electronic Challan System.
How does the e-Challan work?When an RTO or a Police Officer issues an e-Challan using an electronic device for a violation of any M.V. Act and related rules, a copy is handed over to the driver. Additionally, an SMS notification is sent to the vehicle owner's registered mobile number, containing details of the traffic offense. The e-Challan can also be viewed through the mParivahan app.
What happens if I don't pay the e-challan?Non-payment of the traffic e-challan will result in it being forwarded to the court, and the motor vehicle owner will have to make the payment in court. Moreover, certain vehicle services like Transfer of Ownership, Hypothecation Addition or Termination, etc., will be blocked in VAHAN4 until the e-Challan is disposed of.
Within how many days do I have to pay the traffic e-challan?You are required to pay the e-challan within 15 days from the date of issuance. Failure to pay the traffic e-challan within this period will lead to the Prosecution report (PR) being sent to the court.
Can I make the e-challan payment through Credit or Debit card?Yes, you can make the payment through credit or debit card at the time of issue of the e-Challan by RTOs or Police Officers. If the e-Challan was already issued, you can also pay online using a credit or debit card.
In which app can the owner/driver show MV documents?MV documents can be shown through the mParivahan and Digilocker apps. These apps do not require the scan copy of RC and DL to be uploaded; instead, the virtual documents are automatically available after submitting vehicle details.
Can Driving Licence be suspended for an issued e-Challan?Yes, Driving Licence may be suspended for three months for a driver if the offense relates to U/S 206(4) of the M.V. Act, 1988.
How to search e-Challan of a vehicle?Vehicle owners can search for e-Challan through the website https://echallan.parivahan.gov.in/index/accused-challan and also in the mParivahan App. In the mParivahan App, the vehicle owner can search for e-challan by submitting the e-challan number or vehicle registration number along with the chassis number.
